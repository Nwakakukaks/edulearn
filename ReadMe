# EduLang

## Overview

**EduLang** is revolutionizing language learning with its decentralized mentorship platform on the **Open Campus Codex Blockchain**. Our mission is to create a global community where language learners and experienced tutors connect directly, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance the learning experience and reward active participation.

## Inspiration

EduLang was inspired by the vision of creating a decentralized mentorship platform dedicated to language learning. Our goal is to leverage blockchain technology to connect language learners with experienced tutors in a decentralized manner, fostering a global community of language enthusiasts.

EduLang draws inspiration from the widespread popularity of language learning platforms like Duolingo, which has attracted millions of language learners worldwide. While Duolingo and similar platforms have revolutionized language learning, they still face limitations in providing personalized, one-on-one mentorship experiences. In contrast, EduLang aims to disrupt the traditional language learning paradigm by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. By harnessing the decentralized nature of blockchain, EduLang offers a unique mentorship platform where creators and users are rewarded for their engagement, going beyond the standardized curriculum of existing language learning platforms.

## Benefits of Blockchain Integration

EduLang represents a paradigm shift in language learning, leveraging blockchain technology to offer a truly decentralized mentorship platform. Unlike traditional language apps, EduLang offers the following advantages:

- **Decentralization:** By decentralizing the mentorship process, EduLang eliminates the need for intermediaries, ensuring transparent and trustless interactions between mentors and mentees.
- **Personalization:** Unlike one-size-fits-all approaches, EduLang allows users to find mentors tailored to their specific learning needs and preferences, fostering personalized learning experiences.
- **Incentive Mechanisms:** Token-based incentives such as tips for tutors and NFT badges for successfully completed sessions drive active participation from mentors and learners, creating a dynamic ecosystem.
- **AI Quiz and Tutors:** Quick tests are generated by AI according to user experience levels (Novice, Beginner, Intermediate). Upon completion, users are granted NFT badges as proof of successful participation.

## Open Campus ID Connect SDK

EduLang integrates Open Campus ID Connect SDK, offering social logins from Google, Twitter, and other platforms. This seamless onboarding experience bridges the gap between web2 and web3 environments, inviting millions to explore the transformative potential of blockchain in language learning.

## How it Works

- **Mentorship System:** The EduLang smart contract enables users to register as mentors or mentees. Mentors can set session fees, and mentees can request mentorship by paying these fees using USDC or another specified ERC-20 token. The contract facilitates the tracking of mentorship requests, allowing mentors to accept or reject them accordingly.
- **Token Transactions:** Token transactions within the smart contract ensure that mentees have approved the contract to spend their tokens, thus enabling seamless payment for mentorship sessions. Upon acceptance of a mentorship request, a portion of the session fee is transferred to the mentor, incentivizing participation and contribution to the platform.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** To enhance flexibility and interoperability, the EduLang smart contract includes functions for cross-chain compatibility. This feature enables the transfer of session fees to specified destination chains, facilitating seamless transactions across different blockchain networks.

## How We Built It

The EduLang smart contract was developed using Solidity, leveraging the powerful capabilities of the OpenZeppelin library for ERC-20 token functionality. Building upon existing contracts such as MentorContract and eduCCIP, we extended their functionalities to create a robust and comprehensive mentorship system tailored to language learning.

## Ecosystem Impact and Integration

- **Contribution to Open Campus Codex Ecosystem:** EduLang enriches the Open Campus Codex Blockchain by driving TVL through mentorship session fees and staking rewards, attracting a diverse user base of learners and tutors.
- **Integration with Existing Projects:** EduLang complements existing projects by providing a decentralized, personalized education solution that integrates seamlessly with other blockchain-based educational tools and services.

## Community Engagement

- **Engagement and Growth:** EduLang actively engages the community through token-based incentives, NFT rewards, and interactive features. We plan to host community events, webinars, and feedback sessions to foster ongoing participation and growth.
- **Features for Participation:** Our platform includes features like token tips for tutors and NFT badges for learners, which encourage active involvement and contribution from all users.

## Innovation and Originality

- **Unique and Creative Idea:** EduLang introduces a novel approach to language learning by combining blockchain technology with personalized mentorship and AI-generated quizzes. This innovative model sets it apart from traditional learning platforms.
- **Novel Solutions:** By decentralizing mentorship and incorporating blockchain incentives, EduLang addresses the limitations of current language learning platforms, offering a more personalized and rewarding learning experience.
